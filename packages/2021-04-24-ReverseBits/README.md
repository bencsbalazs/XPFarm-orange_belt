# Reverse bits

Write a function that reverses the bits in an integer.
For example, the number 417 is 110100001 in binary. Reversing the binary is 100001011 which is 267.
You can assume that the number is not negative.

## User story 1

> As a user, I have to know if the input is an integer

- Test 1: The input is not Number
- Test 2: The input is not negative

## User story 2

> I need to know the reversed binary as decimal

- Test 1: The output is a Number
- The output is not Negative
